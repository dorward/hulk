# Hulk

Hulk is an experiment in [Ink by Inkle](https://www.inklestudios.com/ink/).

It is in the early stages of development (it hasn't even reached the proof of concept state) so don't expect too much yet.

A production build can be seen at [https://dorward.github.io/hulk/](https://dorward.github.io/hulk/).

## Installation

Check the code out from Git.

Run `npm install` in the project directory.

Then run `npm srun start` to run the development server.
